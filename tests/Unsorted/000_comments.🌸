; We use the semicolon for comments, as we do not need it for separating statements in blossom
; They act by default as the // does in the C family of languages
; We also have the equivalent of the /* */ by just using ;; ;; that can be used multiline or only for commenting a part of a line
; Do note that we can nest the double semicolons, unlike in C and C++

; This is a simple comment
;; This
is
a
multiline
comment;; ; And this is another comment ; Still a comment
