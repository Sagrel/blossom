# Roadmap

Creating a programming language is a long process, so in this section I map out the full list of steps that I have planned.

Each version is separated in language and tooling objectives, as they are mostly independent, but tooling is crucial for a language to be usefull!

Note that this page is just a roadmap, with checkboxes to track progres. It does not contain in depth analisys or my though process.

- [ ] Blossom v1 - The beggining:  
	- Language
		- [ ] Basic support for primitive types and literals: Text, Int, Real, Bool, Lambda, ...
		- [ ] Basic support for defining external functions
		- [ ] UFCS
		- [ ] Function overloading
		- [ ] If statement
		- [ ] Loop statement + continue + break
		- [ ] Comments
		- [ ] Single file
		- [ ] Code compiles and runs with errors, they get turned into runtime errors
	- Tooling
		- [ ] Basic CLI tool that compiles 1 file at a time
			- [ ] Tokenizer
			- [ ] Flat Ast parser
			- [ ] Bidirectional type checker with no unification pass
			- [ ] Nice error reporting
			- [ ] Code generation with Cranelift
			- [ ] Interpreter
			- [ ] Auto formating
			- [ ] Stat collection (performance, number of instances, ...)
			- [ ] Detailed tracing
			- [ ] Setup for snapshot and fuzz testing
- [ ] Blossom v2 - Expanding:
	- Language
		- [ ] Multi file support (no circular dependencies)
		- [ ] Visibility modifiers
		- [ ] namespacing
	- Tooling
		- [ ] Watch command that is resilient and does not crash
		- [ ] Multi threading
		- [ ] Caching
- [ ] Blossom v3 - Let there be structure:
	- Language
		- [ ] Structured types
			- [ ] Tuples (unnamed fields)
			- [ ] Records (named fields)
			- [ ] Variants (tagged unions)
		- [ ] Closures
		- [ ] Default arguments
		- [ ] Match statement
		- [ ] Automatically call `drop` at the end of the scope
	- Tooling
		- [ ] Simple LSP server
			- [ ] Syntax highligting
			- [ ] Type information on hover
			- [ ] Inlay hints
			- [ ] Go to definition
			- [ ] Run project (automatically downloads the compiler)
			- [ ] Reuses the cached information from the compiler

- [ ] Blossom v4 - Another generic name:
	- Language
		- [ ] Generic functions
		- [ ] Generic structs
		- [ ] Generic inference
		- [ ] Interfaces
	- Tooling
		- [ ] Doc generator
		- [ ] Debug information
- [ ] Blossom v5 - It's a match!:
	- Language
		- [ ] Exhaustive pattern matching
		- [ ] Everything is a pattern
	- Tooling
		- [ ] Maintenance
- [ ] Blossom v6 - May I borrow that?:
	- Language
		- [ ] References
		- [ ] Lifetimes
		- [ ] Borrow checking
	- Tooling
		- [ ] Maintenance
- [ ] Blossom v7 - Effects:
	- Language
		- [ ] Stackless cooroutines
		- [ ] Algebraic effect tracking
		- [ ] Syntax for using effects
		- [ ] For loop syntactic sugar
		- [ ] Effect based iterator library
		- [ ] Effect based async library
	- Tooling
		- [ ] Maintenance
- [ ] Blossom v8 - Going meta:
	- Language
		- [ ] Meta programming capabilities
			- [ ] Compile time `if`
			- [ ] Compile time `for`
			- [ ] Compile time error -> Enables linear types
	- Tooling
		- [ ] Maintenance
- [ ] Blossom v9+ - The future:
	- Language
		- [ ] Dependent types, where an Int from 0 to 7 is a day of the week
	- Tooling
		- [ ] [DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)
		- [ ] Profiling instrumentation
		- [ ] Package manager
		- [ ] Hot reloading
