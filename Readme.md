# What is this repo?

One of my dreams is to create my own programming language, and I have made some attempts before (you can find them in my profile), but they were failures (for my standard)

In this repo I plan to fully specify the blossom language ðŸŒ¸! I want to have a complete specification and set of tests before writing a single line of code.

My hope is that having a clear roadmap to target and a set of tests to verify my desing before implementing it, I will create the foundation needed to reach my goals ðŸ¤ž

# Feature of the language

The full list of functionalities of the language can be found in the [roadmap](/roadmap.md), in the order that I plan to implement them. The general idea is to have all the features expected in a modern language, while also experimenting with some more foward looking ideas like effects and linear types.

We want blossom to be easy to read and achieve the levels of simplicity that Go and Zig boast of having, even though in my opinion their path to simplicity is not the right one! I like abstraction and unified syntax, making implicit what should be implicit but always having access to it. That is a bit the philosofy of blossom, and that is what I try to respect when designing it
